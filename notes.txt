- Quiz page
- look at randomising which question loads (removing questions that have already been asked)
- button for next question to show if correct
- look at data format for quiz page and where it sits (send data prop to QuestionType component)



Notes from last session/plan:
- last time we: 
    - added page values based on data (question and answered displayed on the page including answer buttons) 
    - completed a basic function in QuestionTypeOne that determined whether the selected button matched the correct answer and console logged correct or incorrect and displayed the child's inputted name
- next time: 
    - create current question index number as a state variable
    - create a function that creates a random number between 0 and 2 and sets the index variable to that number (attach the function to a 'next question' button)
    - change the 'hard coded' index numbers in the return of QuestionTypeOne to be the index variable
    - some basic styling


make 2 Colour components (PrimaryColour and SecondaryColour)
 - create route paths for colours on Learn page
 - create Learn function 
 

Quiz Data
 Each data object in the array will have:
 - questionType (1, 2, or 3)
 - Question colours (two primary colours or the colour you're trying to make)
 - Answer colour/s

 Functionality will have to look at the answer colours and compare with user selection to determine correct or incorrect


Question Type One 
The user is given two colours and asked to select the colour that those colours make when mixed together
There are three possible question/answer combinations:
- yellow & blue = green (purple, orange)
- blue & red = purple (green, orange)
- red & yellow = orange (purple, green)

Question Type Two
The user is given one colour and asked to select the two colours that make that colour when mixed together
There are three possible question/answer combinations:
- orange = red & yellow (blue)
- purple = blue & red (yellow)
- green = blue & yellow (red)
MVP: correct and incorrect message
(ideas: different messages for when incorrect combo selected)

Question Type Three
The user is presented with a colour and asked to select from a number of images which images are the same colour
